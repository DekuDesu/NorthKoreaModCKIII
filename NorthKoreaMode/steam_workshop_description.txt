[h1]What is 'North Korea Mode?'[h1]
'North Korea Mode' in crusader kings is the colloquial term for playing
without having, or having few vassals. Doing so normally would
impact your levies and gold per month as you are over your holding
limit. This mod re-enables it as the game was released with this
mechanic, and furthermore, this is how it works in Crusader Kings II
as well.
